function im2 = blockproc3(im, blksz, fun, border, numworkers)
% BLOCKPROC3  Block processing for a 3D image
%
% Sometimes images are too large to be processed in one block. Matlab
% provides function blockproc(), that works on 2D images only. This
% blockproc3() function, on the other hand, works also with 3D images.
%
% IM2 = blockproc3(IM, BLKSZ, FUN)
%
%   IM is a 2D or 3D-array with the input grayscale image.
%
%   IM2 is the ouput image, processed by blocks, with the same size as IM.
%
%   BLKSZ is a 2- or 3-vector with the size of the blocks the image will be
%   split into. The last block in every row, column and slice will be
%   smaller, if the image cannot accommodate it.
%
%   FUN is a function handle. This is the processing applied to every
%   block.
%
% IM2 = blockproc3(IM, BLKSZ, FUN, BORDER)
%
%  BORDER is a 2- or 3-vector with the size of the border around each
%  block. Basically, each block size will be grown by this amount, the
%  block processed, and then the border cut off from the solution. This is
%  useful to avoid "seams" in IM2.
%
% Example:
%
%       fun = @(x) deconvblind(x, ones(20, 20, 10));
%       im2 = blockproc3d(im, [256 256 128], fun, [30 30 10]);
%
% IM2 = blockproc3(..., NUMWORKERS)
%
%   NUMWORKERS is an integer to activate parallel processing. If the
%   Parallel Computing Toolbox is available and NUMWORKERS>1, each image
%   block will be processed as a parallel job, using up to NUMWORKERS cores
%   at the same time. By default, NUMWORKERS=1, and parallel processing is
%   disabled.
%
%   Note that in parallel model, FUN gets wrapped in parallel jobs. Thus,
%   execution can be interrupted by pressing CTRL+C even when FUN is a C++
%   MEX file.
%
%   Parallel processing works by first splitting the image into blocks with
%   borders, assigning processing of each block to a separate job, then
%   processing each block, and finally trimming the borders and
%   reassembling the results into the output image.
%
%   This will increase the amount of necessary memory, but this function is
%   relatively efficient in the sense that only blocks being processed take
%   up extra memory (blocks waiting in the job queue don't). 
%
%   The speed improvement may not be as good as expected (e.g. 4 processor
%   will make the processing only 2x faster), as Matlab function can be
%   already more or less optimised to make use of several processors.
%
%   To use this option, it is important to NOT have created a pool of
%   workers in Matlab with "matlabpool open", as this would block all local
%   resources, and not leave any cores free for processing the image
%   blocks. A simple example:
%
%      % median filtering using a 19x19x19 voxel neighbourhood, processing
%      % the image by blocks, using parallel computations
%      matlabpool open
%      sz = [19 19 19];
%      fun = @(x) medfilt3(x, sz);
%      im2 = blockproc3(im, [128 128 64], fun, (sz+1)/2, true);
%      matlabpool close
